# OpenCV Project - Number Plate Detection
---
### This repository contains Python code for real-time number plate detection using OpenCV. The code utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier, specifically trained for detecting Russian license plates. When a license plate is detected, it is highlighted with a rectangle and its region of interest (ROI) is shown in a separate window. The user can also save the detected license plates by pressing 'p' on the keyboard.
